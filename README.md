# softband24

SoftBand24 = bounded propagation: limits on *rate and reach*, not on existence or memory.

This repo is a lightweight anchor for notes + infographics connecting:
- physics bounds (e.g., Lieb–Robinson cones, horizons)
- ML bounds (attention sparsity, routing, locality constraints)
- “no-collapse” framing: exchange continues, instant collapse doesn’t.

## Core idea
**Seconds persist as bounded exchange.**  
Not “finite,” just constrained.

## Contents
- `/notes` — short writeups (one idea per file)
- `/figures` — infographics + alt text
- `/prompts` — reusable X / Bluesky post templates (optional)

## Status
Work in progress. Keep it minimal, testable, and citeable.
