# Bounded ≠ Finite

SoftBand24 uses **bounded propagation**, not finitude.

Bounds apply to:
- rate
- reach
- locality

They do **not** imply loss of existence, memory, or exchange.

## Physics
Lieb–Robinson bounds limit how fast correlations propagate.
They do not destroy information.
Exchange continues inside the cone.

## Machine Learning
Attention sparsity and routing windows limit interaction scope.
They do not imply model collapse or zeroed memory.

## Claim
**Seconds persist as bounded exchange.**
Instant collapse is a modeling error, not a physical necessity.
